## TokenMe Data

The basis of the TokenMe solution is to collect and process `TTL` or "Token Time Location"; 

- `Anchors` are compact devices (16x8x6 cm) that are mounted on a walls or such all over a building or site, and that "listen" for the presence of Tokens, and reporting any data to a central server
- `Tokens` are lightweight, wearable devices (5cm diameter, 1cm thick) that continuously send their presence/location with sensor-data to Anchors, using radio-technology
- `TCS` or "TokenMe Cloud Server" collects all this data, stores it for long-term usage, analysis, monitoring and reports.
